Gighub development policy:

1 => Develop and test Gighub sproutcore app with fixtures.
2 => Change store to be created from DataSource.
3 => Build and copy app to Rails repo.
3 => Any required Rails changes?
        No => Goto 4.
        Yes => Develop and test in Rails environment.
4 => Push to production!

Note: If debugging Rails, Sproutcore communication,
      use a script to build and copy app to Rails.
      Ok to have longer latency between integration tests.
      Don't use proxy, because you will have to keep switching.
